We are looking for relentless and passionate builders to join our team to drive Holistics towards that mission.\n\nAnd as a Product Manager of Holistics, you will be able to learn and get involved in building a simple yet powerful high-tech product that is directly shaping the data industry.\n\nHOW WE BUILD PRODUCT\n‍\nProduct Culture\n\n- Autonomous but aligned: We adapt the Spotify Squad Model. Our team is split into 4 Squads, each (5-7 members consists of PM, PD, and Engineers work autonomously together. Each has its own mission, strategy, and goals that contribute to our product\'s overall vision.\n- We embrace transparency culture across the company. We make sure that everyone know what\'s going on and have access to any information they need to make informed decisions, whether it is a technical document, a revenue dashboard, or a strategy discussion.\n- We have a strong writing (doc-first) culture. Documents create transparency and clarity of thought, almost everything in Holistics is communicated through written documents. Everybody has to learn the best practices in writing and note-taking such as (Evergreen Notes [1], PKM [2], Zettelkasten, etc.)\n- Customer-informed, not Customer-driven. We observe and listen carefully to our customers, but we don\'t try to build everything they ask for. We strive to empathize, learn their real needs, and figure out how they would fit into our vision.\n- Data-informed, not Data-driven. Product management is an intersection of science and art, data are used to inform our decisions, strengthen our intuition rather than to be relied on.\n- We maintain a problem-solving culture. Everyone is strongly encouraged to have rigorous understanding of a problem, separating Problem Space vs Solution Space [3] as well as using Eigenquestions [4] to find the most important dimensions of a problem. Solutions are deliberated over with trade-offs explicitly listed in discussion documentation. Watch this talk on problem-solving for engineers [5] (Vietnamese) from our cofounder.\n- We do not compromise product quality for artificial deadline. We find the balance between moving fast and thinking deeply about long-term product vision and architecture.\n- Everyone is a builder, Experimentation Culture\n- Continuous learning: We encourage people to learn and share, because each member is an atom of the product/company’s success: We have a weekly TED talk [6] program where team members present about topics they are interested in; Engineering Team organizes weekly technical talks [7] as well as monthly technical workshops; Product Team has regular AMA events with external product experts, and Happy Sharing events to share what have we learn; We share what we learn in every meeting with have, and on every channel we communicate\n‍\nProduct Principles\n\nProduct Principles inform how we build, design, and make decisions when developing products.\n\n- Always start with problem: The key to success is identifying the right problem to solve. Always start everything with deeply understanding of the problems to be solved, be clearly aware of the problem and solution spaces.\n- Customer-Centric: We build products to make our customers\' lives better. Constantly talk to our customers and observe how they use product to understand deeply their challenges at work.\n- Think Deep, Think Big, Start Small: Think in long-term, envision how the product will evolve and fit into the big picture. Then start with a smallest coherent solution. Always ask yourself how can you ship sooner and learn faster.\n- Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible: Data Analytics is huge space, and data tools are usually complex. We challenge ourselves to build a powerful analytics product that is also easy to use, allowing anyone to make data-informed decisions.\n- Prioritize Ruthlessly: We must deprioritize a lot of things in order to do what we prioritize. Each feature increases maintenance cost, operational cost, and the product complexity. It is better to focus on doing a few things well than many things half-assed.\n- Empowered Product Team: We always start with the problem, instead of a list of features, everyone is empowered to dig deeper into the problem space, define their own approach and strategy to solve the problem. - Empowered - Marty Cagan [8]. We substantially invest in individuals to reach their potential, because we believe each individual\'s success generates compounding growth for the entire product.\n‍\nWHAT WILL YOU BE DOING & LEARNING\n\nLearn by doing, be the owner of what you build (Discover, Build, Launch, Measure, Learn, Lead)\n\n????
